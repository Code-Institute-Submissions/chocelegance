The idea for the PP5 project is to create an online shop (Chocelegance.nl) that sells high quality artisan chocolates, users will be able to purchase hand a range of different chocolate offerings and also engage catering services for special occasions. This will be a real life use case, with the aim of deploying it in the 'real world' when it's finished.

However, the project is not complete. I was not able to cover the material for this part of the course in time, I've spoken to the Student Support team and explained my current cicrumstances and provided the details, documents and related supporting materials (legal letters, recording of evidence etc).
